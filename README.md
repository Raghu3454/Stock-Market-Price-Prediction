# 📈 Stock Market Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the next day's stock closing price using historical stock market data and a Machine Learning approach (Linear Regression).

The objective of this project is to understand financial time-series data and apply regression techniques to forecast stock prices.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Yahoo Finance (using yFinance library)
- Feature Used: Closing Price
- Time Period: 2015 – 2024
- Target Variable: Next day's closing price

---

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- yFinance

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Download historical stock data using yFinance
2. Create a prediction column by shifting closing prices
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate model performance using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
6. Visualize Actual vs Predicted prices

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

- **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains variance
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – Measures average squared prediction error
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Measures average absolute prediction error

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✔ Real-time stock data fetching  
✔ Data preprocessing and cleaning  
✔ Linear Regression model training  
✔ Performance evaluation  
✔ Visualization of stock price trends  
✔ Next-day stock price prediction

## 📷 Output Visualization

The project includes a graphical comparison between:
- Actual Stock Prices
- Predicted Stock Prices

This helps in understanding model performance visually.
